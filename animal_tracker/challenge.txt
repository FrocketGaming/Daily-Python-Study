CHALLENGE:
1. Problem Description:

Write a Python program to help a zookeeper keep track of animal counts. The zookeeper has a list of animals and the number of each animal currently in the zoo. Your task is to:

    Prompt the user to enter an animal's name.
    If the animal exists in the list, display how many of that animal are in the zoo.
    If the animal does not exist in the list, add it to the list with a count of 1 and notify the user.

2. Example Input and Output:

Example 1:

Current animals: {'lion': 5, 'tiger': 3, 'elephant': 2}
Enter an animal name: tiger
Output: There are 3 tigers in the zoo.

Example 2:

Current animals: {'lion': 5, 'tiger': 3, 'elephant': 2}
Enter an animal name: zebra
Output: Zebra added to the zoo with a count of 1.

3. Constraints and Requirements:

    Assume the initial list of animals is pre-defined as {'lion': 5, 'tiger': 3, 'elephant': 2}.
    Animal names should be treated case-insensitively (e.g., "Tiger" is the same as "tiger").
    The program should be beginner-friendly and use basic Python constructs such as dictionaries, input, and conditionals.
