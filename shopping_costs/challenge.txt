CHALLENGE:

    Problem Description
    You are tasked with writing a Python function that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping list. Each item has a name, quantity, and price per unit. Your function should return the total cost rounded to two decimal places.

Write a function calculate_total_cost(shopping_list) that takes in a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents an item with the following keys:

    "name": The name of the item (string).
    "quantity": The quantity of the item (integer).
    "price_per_unit": The price per unit of the item (float).

The function should calculate the total cost by multiplying the quantity by the price per unit for each item and summing these values.

    Example Input and Output
    Input:

shopping_list = [
    {"name": "Apple", "quantity": 4, "price_per_unit": 0.5},
    {"name": "Banana", "quantity": 6, "price_per_unit": 0.3},
    {"name": "Milk", "quantity": 1, "price_per_unit": 1.2}
]

Output:

Total cost: 5.0

    Constraints and Requirements

    Assume the input will always be a list of dictionaries, and each dictionary will always have the keys "name", "quantity", and "price_per_unit".
    Quantities will always be non-negative integers, and prices will always be non-negative floats.
    Return the result rounded to two decimal places.
    Do not use any external libraries.
