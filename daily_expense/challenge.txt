CHALLENGE:

    Problem Description:
    You are creating a simple program to help a friend track their weekly expenses. Write a Python function called calculate_weekly_expenses that takes a list of daily expenses (floats) as input and calculates the following:
        The total expenses for the week.
        The average daily expense.
        The day with the highest expense (return the day as a string, e.g., "Monday").

    The function should return a dictionary with these values.

    Example Input and Output:

# Example input:
daily_expenses = [12.50, 8.75, 15.00, 10.00, 18.25, 9.50, 13.75]

# Example output:
{
    "total_expenses": 87.75,
    "average_daily_expense": 12.54,
    "highest_expense_day": "Friday"
}

Constraints and Requirements:

    The input list will always have exactly 7 values, representing the expenses for Monday through Sunday.
    The program should round the average daily expense to 2 decimal places.
    If two or more days share the same highest expense, return the first day (earliest in the week).
    Use the following day names in order: ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"].
