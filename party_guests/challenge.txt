Problem Description
You are organizing a party, and you need to create a guest list based on RSVPs. Write a Python program that takes a list of guest names as input, removes duplicate names, and sorts the names alphabetically. Finally, print the unique, sorted guest list.

Example Input and Output
Input:
["Alice", "Bob", "Alice", "Charlie", "Bob", "David"]
Output:
["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]

Constraints and Requirements

    The input list will contain at least one name and no more than 50 names.
    Each name in the list will be a string of alphabetical characters, no longer than 20 characters.
    The output must be a sorted list with no duplicates.
    You must use Pythonâ€™s built-in features like sets and list methods to solve the problem.
